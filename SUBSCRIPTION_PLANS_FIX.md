# üîß Fix: Subscription Packages Not Appearing During Setup

## üéØ **Root Cause Identified**

The subscription packages are not appearing because **the user needs to be logged in** to access them. The database has Row Level Security (RLS) policies that require authentication.

## ‚úÖ **Current Status**

- ‚úÖ **Database**: Subscription plans exist (3 plans found)
- ‚úÖ **Tables**: All required tables are set up
- ‚úÖ **Functions**: Organization creation functions exist
- ‚ùå **Authentication**: User needs to be logged in

## üöÄ **Solution Steps**

### **Step 1: Ensure User is Logged In**

1. **Go to your application**
   - Visit: `http://localhost:5173`
   - You should be redirected to `/login` if not authenticated

2. **Log in or Register**
   - Use your email: `andre4094@gmail.com`
   - Or register a new account

3. **Verify Authentication**
   - After login, you should be redirected to `/setup`
   - Check that you're logged in by looking at the top navigation

### **Step 2: Test Plans Loading**

1. **Visit the Debug Page**
   - Go to: `http://localhost:5173/debug/plans-new`
   - This will show you if plans are loading correctly

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Check the Network tab for failed API requests

### **Step 3: If Plans Still Don't Appear**

#### **Option A: Check RLS Policies**

If you're logged in but plans still don't appear, the RLS policies might be too restrictive. Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check current RLS policies
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'subscription_plans';

-- If no policies exist, create a simple one
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read subscription plans" ON subscription_plans
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

#### **Option B: Temporarily Disable RLS (for testing)**

```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS for testing
ALTER TABLE subscription_plans DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Test if plans appear now
-- If they do, the issue is with RLS policies

-- Re-enable RLS after testing
ALTER TABLE subscription_plans ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

#### **Option C: Create Public Access Policy**

```sql
-- Create a policy that allows public access to active plans
CREATE POLICY "Allow public access to active subscription plans" ON subscription_plans
    FOR SELECT USING (is_active = true);
```

## üîç **Debugging Steps**

### **1. Check Authentication Status**

```javascript
// In browser console
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('User:', user);
```

### **2. Test Plans Query**

```javascript
// In browser console
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('subscription_plans')
  .select('*')
  .eq('is_active', true);
console.log('Plans:', data, 'Error:', error);
```

### **3. Check Network Requests**

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for requests to `subscription_plans`
5. Check if they're successful (200) or failing (401/403)

## üéØ **Expected Behavior**

After logging in, you should see:

1. **Organization Setup Page** (`/setup`)
2. **Subscription Plans Section** with 3 plans:
   - Starter ($29/month)
   - Professional ($79/month) 
   - Enterprise ($199/month)
3. **Professional plan pre-selected**
4. **Plan features displayed**

## üö® **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: "No subscription plans available"**
- **Cause**: User not authenticated or RLS blocking access
- **Solution**: Log in first, then check RLS policies

### **Issue 2: Plans load but don't display**
- **Cause**: JavaScript error in the frontend
- **Solution**: Check browser console for errors

### **Issue 3: "Database error" message**
- **Cause**: RLS policy too restrictive
- **Solution**: Update RLS policies as shown above

### **Issue 4: Plans appear but can't select**
- **Cause**: Plan data structure issue
- **Solution**: Check plan features JSON format

## üìã **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] User is logged in (`/setup` page loads)
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] Network requests to `subscription_plans` return 200
- [ ] Plans array has 3 items
- [ ] Professional plan is pre-selected
- [ ] Plan features display correctly
- [ ] Can select different plans
- [ ] Can proceed to organization creation

## üîß **Quick Fix Commands**

### **If you need to reset everything:**

```bash
# 1. Clear browser data
# 2. Log out and log back in
# 3. Run the database setup again
```

### **If RLS is the issue:**

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read subscription plans" ON subscription_plans
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## üéâ **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:

- ‚úÖ You can see 3 subscription plans on the setup page
- ‚úÖ Professional plan is highlighted/selected
- ‚úÖ Plan prices and features are displayed
- ‚úÖ You can switch between plans
- ‚úÖ The "Create Organization" button is enabled

**üéØ The main issue is authentication - make sure you're logged in before accessing the setup page!**
