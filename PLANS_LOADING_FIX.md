# 🔧 SUBSCRIPTION PLANS LOADING FIX

## The Issue
Subscription plans are not loading during organization setup, preventing users from completing the sign-up process.

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

### Solution 1: Use Demo Plans (Works Instantly)
1. **Go to organization setup** page (`/setup`)
2. **Wait 5 seconds** - demo plans will load automatically
3. **OR click "📦 Load Demo Plans & Continue Setup"** for instant loading
4. **Complete organization setup** normally

### Solution 2: Fix Database (Permanent Fix)
1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste** the entire contents of `emergency_seed_plans.sql`
3. **Click "Run"**
4. **Refresh** the organization setup page
5. **Plans should now load from database**

### Solution 3: Quick Database Check
Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor to check if plans exist:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as plan_count FROM subscription_plans WHERE is_active = true;
```
- **If 0**: Plans don't exist - use Solution 2
- **If 3**: Plans exist but RLS is blocking - use Solution 4

### Solution 4: Fix RLS Permissions
If plans exist but aren't loading, run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Fix subscription plans RLS policy
ALTER TABLE subscription_plans ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Everyone can view subscription plans" ON subscription_plans;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can view subscription plans" ON subscription_plans;

CREATE POLICY "Public read access to subscription plans" ON subscription_plans
    FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Grant access to all users
GRANT SELECT ON subscription_plans TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON subscription_plans TO anon;
```

## 🔍 DIAGNOSIS STEPS

### Step 1: Check What You See
During organization setup, you should see one of these:

#### ✅ **Success (What You Want)**
```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐

   - `"Auto-loading mock plans after 5 seconds"`

### Step 3: Test Debug Pages

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Plans never load (even demo plans)
**Solutions:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try different browser or incognito mode
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check network connection

### Issue: Database query fails
**Solutions:**
- Verify Supabase project URL and keys in `.env.local`
- Check if Supabase project is active
- Run the emergency seed SQL script
- Check RLS policies with Solution 4

### Issue: Plans load but look broken
**Solutions:**
- Check if plan features are properly formatted JSON
- Verify all required plan fields exist
- Use the emergency seed script to recreate with proper data

### Issue: Can't proceed past plan selection
**Solutions:**
- Ensure at least one plan is selected (Professional is auto-selected)
- Check browser console for form validation errors
- Try using demo plans instead of database plans

## 📊 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX

### Immediate (Demo Plans)
- ✅ **Organization setup works** immediately with demo plans
- ✅ **User can complete sign-up** and access dashboard
- ✅ **All features work** normally with demo subscription
- ✅ **Can switch to real plans** later after fixing database

### After Database Fix
- ✅ **Plans load from database** automatically
- ✅ **Real subscription plans** with proper pricing
- ✅ **Feature gating works** based on selected plan
- ✅ **Billing integration ready** for future payment processing

### Long-term
- ✅ **New users sign up** smoothly without issues
- ✅ **Plan upgrades/downgrades** work properly
- ✅ **Feature access** controlled by subscription
- ✅ **Multi-tenant isolation** works correctly

## 🆘 EMERGENCY BYPASS

If nothing else works, temporarily skip plan selection:

1. **Edit** `src/pages/OrganizationSetup.tsx`
2. **Find line ~206**: `if (!user || !selectedPlan) {`
3. **Change to**: `if (!user) {`
4. **Comment out**: `// || !selectedPlan`
5. **Save and reload**

This allows organization creation without plan selection (not recommended for production).

## ✅ SUCCESS CHECKLIST

Verify these work after applying the fix:

- ☐ **Organization setup page loads** without errors
- ☐ **3 plan cards are visible** (Starter, Professional, Enterprise)
- ☐ **Professional plan is pre-selected** with purple border
- ☐ **Monthly/Yearly toggle works** and updates pricing
- ☐ **Can click plan cards** to select them
- ☐ **Can complete organization setup** successfully
- ☐ **Redirects to dashboard** after creation
- ☐ **Organization context** shows in dashboard header

---

**🎉 Once all items are checked, your subscription plans are working perfectly!**

## 📞 STILL NEED HELP?

If plans still won't load:

1. **Use the demo plans** to complete setup immediately
2. **Check all debug pages** for detailed error information
3. **Run the emergency seed script** in Supabase
4. **Verify environment variables** are correct
5. **Try the bypass method** as last resort

**Remember**: Demo plans work identically to real plans, so you can use them to test the entire application while fixing the database! 🚀
